//variable names can only contain letters, digits, or symbols $ and _ they are also case-sensitive

//An extra variable is good, not evil. saves time on debugging

//const are for unchangeable variables (e.g., my birthday) capital-named constants are only for hard-coded values

const myBirthday = '09.20.1993';

//creates the variable
let message1;

//stores the string 'Hello' int he variable named 'message'
message1 = 'Hello'; 

//to be concise, it can be one line

let message2 = 'Hola';

//Can also declare multiple variables in one line
let message3 = 'Aloha', great = 'You', notgreat = 'Me';

//Best practice is 1 variable per line

let team1 = 'Blue';
let team2 = 'Red';
let game = 'Halo';
